====================================================

Lantz is an automation and instrumentation toolkit with a clean, well-designed
and consistent interface.  It provides a core of commonly used functionalities
for building applications that communicate with scientific instruments allowing
rapid application prototyping, development and testing.

#### arduino-qt-simple

Create an arduino driver, the corresponding sketch and upload it.
Then use a Qt interface to query the value in the arduino.

#### arduino-qt-continuous

Create an arduino driver, the corresponding sketch and upload it.
Then use a Qt interface to query the value in the arduino periodically
or plot it.
